This repository aims to improve the functionality of open-slide's example web application
WARNING: This repository is quite hacky and the code isn't pretty. It seems to work, though. 

Added functionality:

- Each slide is opened with macro, thumbnail & label slide as associated slides (instead of just slide in fullscreen which is the default)
- Slide properties are displayed
- Shift + d for next slide
- Shift + a for previous slide
