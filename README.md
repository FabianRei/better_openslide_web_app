This repository aims to improve the functionality of open-slide's example web application <br>
Just **run improved_multiserver.py** and it gives you more/better functionality compared to deepzoom_multiserver.py <br>
WARNING: This repository is quite hacky and the code isn't pretty. You might not be able to run deepzoom_multiserver.py 
through this repo.

Added functionality:

- Each slide is opened with macro, thumbnail & label slide as associated slides (instead of just slide in fullscreen which is the default)
- Slide properties are displayed
- Shift + d for next slide
- Shift + a for previous slide
